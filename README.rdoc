= Avatars For Rails

Avatars For Rails is a integral solution to provide a model with avatar support.

It includes a database migration and views with jquery.fileupload and jquery.jcrop

It relies on paperclip and imagemagick

= Installation

Add to your Gemfile:

  gem 'avatars_for_rails'

and run:

  bundle update

Then, if you have a class named user and you want it to have avatars, run:

  rails generate avatars_for_rails:install user

This will generate the following:

* A initializer file with configuration for avatars_for_rails.
* A migration providing the database schema for using avatars_for_rails with the user class.

Do not forget to migrate your database

  rake db:migrate
  
In your model, you must include:

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    include AvatarsForRails::Avatarable
  end

For rendering the new avatar form:
  <%= render partial: 'avatars/form',
             object: @user,
             as: :avatarable %>
  
You must include the javascript and css files

  //= require avatars_for_rails

 
If you want to get an user's avatar you can do: 
  user.avatar
  
For rendering an image_tag for an user's avatar:
  <%= avatar(user, options) %>
